# Exercise 01

## Simple website

Given this procedural and simple example of a web site, make it better and more extendable/dynamic.

### Requirements

* Don't create a backend. The pages/templates should be static.
* Don't use a PHP framework (Symfony, Laravel, Silex etc).
* Spend little (or no time at all) on the design and CSS.
* Use a CSS framework if you have to make it pretty.

### Extra credit

* Make use of existing open-source packages (no frameworks).
* Use composer to include those packages.
* Write your own router, template engine etc.
