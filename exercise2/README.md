# Exercise 02

## Blog system

Make a simple blog system with vanilla PHP.

### Pages

* /blog - a list of all blog posts.
* /blog/{id} - a single blog post page.
* /admin - a backend to edit/delete/create posts.

### Requirements

* The backend should be password-protected. ---> YES
* Don't use any existing PHP frameworks or packages. ---> YES
* Spend little (or no time at all) on the design and CSS. ---> YES
* Use a CSS framework if you have to make it pretty. ---> I used this: https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/

### Extra credit
  
* Create the system with TDD.
